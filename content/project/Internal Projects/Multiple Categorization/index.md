Status: in prep.

We've been using Representational Similarity Analysis to test whether we can decode the group identity of multiply-categorized targets. Participants viewed videos of minimal in-group and out-group members who were also racial in-group or out-group members. We've found that we can easily decode either racial or minimal group identity from their EEG, suggesting that both categories are simultaneous represented. We have yet to find a representational structure combining both categories.The goal of the work is to test how the brain differentiates partial from full in-group and out-group members.
