Status: planning follow-up. Look for my poster at SPSP 2020!

It's well established that people often see other groups as less human than their own. But this has hardly been tested using individual members of other groups. Our question is whether group causes of dehumanization carry over to individuals, and whether they interact with other potential sources of dehumanization. We've found that simple trait descriptions can make our targets less human, and that this predicts less attribution of pain (above), greater punishment, and more painful medical decision-making. However, targets' race has no effect. We are planning to follow up to learn more about how individual and group sources of dehumanization interact.
