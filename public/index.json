Look for my poster at SPSP 2020!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s well established that people often see other groups as less human than their own. But this has hardly been tested using individual members of other groups. Our question is whether group causes of dehumanization carry over to individuals, and whether they interact with other potential sources of dehumanization. We\u0026rsquo;ve found that simple trait descriptions can make our targets less human, and that this predicts less attribution of pain (above), greater punishment, and more painful medical decision-making. However, targets\u0026rsquo; race has no effect.

However, a mounting number of studies show that recategorization—even into minimal groups—can overcome the typical consequences of racial and other group classifications. We tested the effects of minimal grouping on implicit prejudice and infrahumanization using a paradigm in which race was orthogonal to group membership. This allowed us to examine whether knowledge of group membership overrides obvious category differences. We found that participants infrahumanized and showed implicit bias toward the minimal outgroup, despite the cross-cutting presence of race, and in fact did not show any of the usual implicit racial bias. In addition, event-related potentials (ERPs) showed an early race effect followed by distinct reactions on the basis of group as processing continued. This is evidence that arbitrary social classifications can engender ingroup preference even in the presence of orthogonal, visually salient categorizations.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Effects of minimal grouping on implicit prejudice, infrahumanization, and neural processing despite orthogonal social categorizations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This is a \u0026ldquo;hello world\u0026rdquo; example website for the blogdown package.

Previous research has shown that sensorimotor resonance, as measured by suppression of the electrophysiological (EEG) mu rhythm, is predicted by trait empathy, but findings are inconsistent. Here we report data from a high-powered study (_N_ = 252) to clarify the relationship between sensorimotor resonance as indexed by mu suppression during action observation and trait empathy as measured by the well-established Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). Our initial pre-registered analyses at central electrode locations indicate that sensorimotor resonance is unrelated to general trait empathy or its sub-facets, however, these effects could not be isolated from attention-related occipital alpha. An additional non-registered analysis using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to look at the isolated central mu-component clarified the relationship. Results confirmed the lack of a relationship between the mu-component and the perspective taking, personal distress, or fantasy facets of the IRI, but suggest a possible association with empathic concern such that greater resonance is associated with greater empathic concern. These results question the previously assumed relationship between trait empathy and sensorimotor resonance and highlight the need to investigate experience sharing tendencies in the context of simulation-based resonance.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Clarifying the relationship between trait empathy and action-based resonance indexed by EEG mu-rhythm suppression.","type":"publication"}]
