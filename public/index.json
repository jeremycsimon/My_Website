While its presence has been well documented in horrific acts of violence, it is also theorized to play a role in everyday life. We measured its presence and effects in face-to-face dyadic interactions between strangers and found that not only was there variance in the extent to which they perceived one another as human, but this variance predicted neural processing and behavior. Specifically, participants showed stronger neural mirroring, indexed by EEG mu-suppression, in response to partners they evaluated as more human, suggesting their brains neurally simulated those targets’ actions more. Participants were also marginally more empathically accurate about the emotions of partners deemed more human and performed better with them on a cooperative task. These results suggest that there are indeed differences in our recognition of the humanity of people we meet—demonstrated for the first time in a real, face-to-face interaction—and that this mundane variation affects our ability to neurally simulate, cooperate, and empathize.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Recognizing humanity: Dehumanization predicts neural mirroring and empathic accuracy in face-to-face interactions.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer N.

Previous research, however, shows that group biases can restrict sensorimotor resonance to the social ingroup. Here we test whether an empathic mindset can alleviate such group biases in sensorimotor resonance. Participants adopted either an objective mindset or a perspective taking mindset while writing about a day in the life of a racial outgroup member. Participants in an objective mindset resonated with ingroup members, indicated by significant suppression of the 8-13 Hz EEG mu-rhythm recorded over sensorimotor areas during action observation compared to baseline, but did not show significant mu-suppression in response to outgroup members. In contrast, participants in a perspective taking mindset resonated with both ingroup and outgroup members and significantly more so with outgroup members. Moreover, mindset uniquely affected resonance in response to outgroup members but not in response to ingroup members, with participants who previously took the perspective of an outgroup member later responding with more resonance to the actions of other outgroup members. Together these findings suggest that taking the perspective of a racial outgroup member can reduce group biases in sensorimotor resonance, potentially fostering an intuitive understanding across groups.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Perspective Taking Reduces Group Biases in Sensorimotor Resonance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marissa A.

Previous research has shown that sensorimotor resonance, as measured by suppression of the electrophysiological (EEG) mu rhythm, is predicted by trait empathy, but findings are inconsistent. Here we report data from a high-powered study (_N_ = 252) to clarify the relationship between sensorimotor resonance as indexed by mu suppression during action observation and trait empathy as measured by the well-established Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). Our initial pre-registered analyses at central electrode locations indicate that sensorimotor resonance is unrelated to general trait empathy or its sub-facets, however, these effects could not be isolated from attention-related occipital alpha. An additional non-registered analysis using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to look at the isolated central mu-component clarified the relationship. Results confirmed the lack of a relationship between the mu-component and the perspective taking, personal distress, or fantasy facets of the IRI, but suggest a possible association with empathic concern such that greater resonance is associated with greater empathic concern. These results question the previously assumed relationship between trait empathy and sensorimotor resonance and highlight the need to investigate experience sharing tendencies in the context of simulation-based resonance.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Clarifying the relationship between trait empathy and action-based resonance indexed by EEG mu-rhythm suppression.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Status: Nearing the end of data collection!\nWe\u0026rsquo;re studying whether interactions between strangers differ as a function of race.

We\u0026rsquo;ve found that we can make targets seem less human with simple trait descriptions, and that this manipulatoin predicts lesser attribution of pain (see figure above), greater punishment, and more painful medical decision-making.

However, a mounting number of studies show that recategorization—even into minimal groups—can overcome the typical consequences of racial and other group classifications. We tested the effects of minimal grouping on implicit prejudice and infrahumanization using a paradigm in which race was orthogonal to group membership. This allowed us to examine whether knowledge of group membership overrides obvious category differences. We found that participants infrahumanized and showed implicit bias toward the minimal outgroup, despite the cross-cutting presence of race, and in fact did not show any of the usual implicit racial bias. In addition, event-related potentials (ERPs) showed an early race effect followed by distinct reactions on the basis of group as processing continued. This is evidence that arbitrary social classifications can engender ingroup preference even in the presence of orthogonal, visually salient categorizations.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Effects of minimal grouping on implicit prejudice, infrahumanization, and neural processing despite orthogonal social categorizations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeremy C.

To discern how warmth and competence might affect neural processing and its downstream behavioral consequences, we manipulated impressions of targets’ warmth and competence and then measured intentions towards the target and motor resonance, a neural process previously linked to social processing. While EEG was recorded, 66 participants watched videos of people performing a simple motor activity and completed a measure of hypothetical intentions to help or harm.  Both perceptions of warmth and competence predicted an increase in helping intentions.  Moreover, participants showed the least motor resonance with high competence-medium warmth targets, suggesting the importance of both social dimensions in driving neural simulation of targets’ actions.  Perceptions of a person’s warmth and competence can thus affect not only how others might intend to treat them, but also how they might process their basic experiences on a neural level.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Social Perceptions of Warmth and Competence Influence Behavioral Intentions and Neural Processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This is a \u0026ldquo;hello world\u0026rdquo; example website for the blogdown package.
