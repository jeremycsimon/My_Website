      <title>Cross-Group Interaction</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Status: Nearing the end of data collection!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re studying whether interactions between strangers differ as a function of race. By comparing pairs of White participants with White/Black pairs we can investigate the effects of interracial interactions on a number of measures of understanding and empathy. Our dependent variables include action coordination, empathic accuracy, and dehumanization, plus EEG measures including mu suppression and neural synchrony. We hope to test whether racial differences affect empathy and communication, and whether these differences are reflected in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Demographic Ignorance</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Status: Under review!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This line of work tests whether changing Americans&amp;rsquo; perceptions of their country&amp;rsquo;s diversity affects their attitudes toward minorities. As you can see above, we&amp;rsquo;ve been surprised to find that making people think minorities make up a larger portion of the population actually decreases their implicit (and explicit) prejudice. It also decreases their conservatism. While lots of recent work has shown that learning that the United States is becoming more diverse makes White Americans more prejudiced and conservative, we show that learning that the United States is &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; diverse decreases these attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interpersonal Dehumanization</title>
      <link>https://jeremycsimon.xyz/project/internal-projects/interpersonal-dehumanization/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Status: Planning follow-up. Look for my poster at SPSP 2020!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s well established that people often see other groups as less human than their own. But does this occur on an individual level? Our question is whether dehumanization on the basis of group carries over to individuals, and what happens when there are additional, independent sources of dehumanization. We&amp;rsquo;ve found that we can make targets seem less human with simple trait descriptions, and that this manipulatoin predicts lesser attribution of pain (see figure above), greater punishment, and more painful medical decision-making. However, targets&amp;rsquo; race has no effect, suggesting that group-based sources of dehumanization may be less salient in some situations. We are planning to follow up to learn more about how individual and group sources of dehumanization interact.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multiple Categorization</title>
      <link>https://jeremycsimon.xyz/project/internal-projects/multiple-categorization/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Status: Manuscript in preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been using Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) on EEG data to compare models of group categorization. Participants viewed videos of minimal in-group and out-group members who were also racial in-group or out-group members. Models can distinguish target race or target minmal group membership for nearly the entire video presentations. Our larger research question, however, is how multiply categorized targets are represented. Are we right to assume that double in-group members (same race, same minimal group) are most different from double out-group members (other race, other minimal group)? Which partial in-group members (same on only one dimension) are represented more similarly to double in-group members? Thus far we have not been able to differentiate models preferring race from models preferring group, but analyses are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
